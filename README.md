# Deriving variables that predict missing data in the CLS cohort studies: NCDS, BCS70, Next Steps, and MCS

## Overview
- This repository provides **Stata do files** that derive variables that predict non-response or missing data in each of the CLS cohort studies: NCDS, BCS70, Next Steps, and MCS. These variables have been identified in an extensive programme of work that informs users on how best to deal with missing data in longitudinal cohort studies.
- The [**handling missing data in the CLS cohort studies user guide**](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Handling-Missing-Data-User-Guide-2024.pdf) provides full information on how the variables predicting missing data have been identified and how they should be used.

## Syntax and data availability

- *Source data:* Download raw data from one or more of the cohort studies from the [**UK Data Service**](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/). For each cohort study, most raw data files for all study sweeps are needed for deriving the final dataset of variables that predict missing data. Place the raw data files in a folder on your computer.       
- *Syntax:* There is a separate do file for each cohort study that reads the raw data files and generates a single dataset for the given cohort study. 
- *Derived dataset:* Available to download from the [**UK Data Service**](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk).
